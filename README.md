# About
RustMan is a tool I developed based on the RCON interface of Rust servers (that's Rust the game by Facepunch). Instead of having to use binary modifications that would cause servers to become "modded" and adding way too much functionality, this mod can run on a completely different machine than the Rust server and does nothing Rust can't do as it only uses RCON commands and therefore already implemented mechanisms.

This version RustMan-C# is the fourth iteration of an undescribable mess that I first caused in PHP and then moved on to C#.

# RCON Fix
This project also requires https://github.com/Gachl/RustRcon and a hotfix that is in the rustrcon folder in this project.

# Operation
You're not supposed to use this. So if you choose to clone and use this project, I'm sorry for you.
This whole project is a mess and completely undocumented as it was never supposed to be released publically. Since Facepunch has decided to turn on full nazi mode I decided to stop working with Rust and I'm proud to say that I haven't played it since. I don't regret a thing.

# Omg halp.
No.

# Rust Legacy
Did I mention that this is for Rust legacy and not the remake. So this is very useless now.
